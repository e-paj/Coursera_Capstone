** Introduction: Business Problem ** 

In this project, we would like to know what is the best possible location for a restaurant in Metro Manila. 
It is officially known as National Capital Region (NCR) and is the capital of the Philippines.

There are a whopping 21,017 hotel and restaurant establishments from a 2000 census done by the Philippine government. 
NCR is comprised of 897 barangays. These are grouped into six congressional districts. 
For the purpose of this project, we will group the restaurants by locality. 

So as part of this, we will list and visualize all major parts of NCR. 

Question that can be asked:
– What is the best location in NCR for a restaurant? 
- Which area have a large number of restaurants? 
– Which of the areas have the least number of restaurants? 
– Which is the best place to stay if I prefer Korean food? 
– What places have high rating of restaurants?

Target Audience:
- Entrepreneurs who are interested in finding the best spot to open a restaurant.
- People who would like to know which locality is best to eat a specific food (ie. Korean).
- People who would like to eat in a restaurant based on the rating.
