** Introduction: Business Problem ** 

In this project, we would like to know what is the best possible location to build a hotel in Cebu, a province of the Philippines. 
Cebu City is its prosperous port capital, boosting 922, 611 in population. However, the province itself has a population that exceeds 3 million. 

It is brimming with wonders of nature such as the pristine white sand beaches, whale sharks, and sardine run that you can swim with. 
It also has breathtaking hills and mountains, historic sites, and delicious foods. It is no wonder Cebu has been a top tourist destination to visit in the Philippines. 

So as part of this, we will list and visualize all major parts of Cebu City. 

Question that can be asked: 
* What is the best location in Cebu City for a hotel? 
* Which area have a large number of hotels? 
* Which of the areas have the least number of hotels? 
* Which is the best place to stay if I prefer near beach? 
* What places have high rating of hotels?
